# Naive Bayes Classifier for Diabetes Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier for predicting diabetes using the diabetes.csv dataset. The goal is to demonstrate the application of Naive Bayes classification in the context of healthcare data.

## Dataset

The diabetes.csv dataset includes various health-related features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc., and a binary outcome indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.

## Project Structure

- `diabetes.csv`: The dataset file in CSV format.
- `naive_bayes_diabetes.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the Naive Bayes classifier implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for this project.

## Naive Bayes Classification

To run the Naive Bayes classifier on the diabetes dataset, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
